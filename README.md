# file-analysis
Overview:

This code is part of an Android application, designed to select, upload, and analyze files for potential threats using the Hybrid Analysis API. It provides a user interface for the user to select a file, displays scanning results in a visually appealing manner using a pie chart, and manages the interactions with the Hybrid Analysis API.
Key Features:

    File Selection: Allows the user to select files from their device.
    File Upload: Once a file is selected, it gets uploaded to the Hybrid Analysis API for scanning.
    Scanning Results: Retrieves scanning results from the Hybrid Analysis API and presents them in a pie chart and cards.
    File Analysis: Uses multiple scanners like crowdstrike_ml, metadefender, and virustotal to analyze the file.
    Dark Mode Setting: Adjusts the UI based on the user's dark mode preference.

Function Descriptions:

    getRecentAPKs(): Retrieves the 10 most recent APK files from the downloads directory.
    onCreateOptionsMenu() & onOptionsItemSelected(): Handle menu inflation and item selection.
    openFileChooser(): Opens a file chooser dialog for the user to select a file.
    onRequestPermissionsResult(): Handles permissions for reading external storage.
    onActivityResult(): Handles the result after selecting a file.
    uploadAndScanFile(Uri): Uploads the selected file to the Hybrid Analysis API and starts the scanning process.
    startRetrievingResults(String): Schedules periodic checks to retrieve the scanning results from the API.
    retrieveResults(String, (Boolean) -> Unit): Retrieves the scanning results for a given ID from the Hybrid Analysis API.
    setupPieChart(PieChart, Map<String, Float>): Sets up the pie chart visualization using the given data.
    processStatus(String, TextView): Updates the status textView based on the status string.
    handleBackPressed(): Handles back button press events to cancel loading if necessary.
    setDarkModeBackground(): Sets the background color based on the user's dark mode preference.

Additional Classes:

    DataPart: Data class to hold file information.
    VolleyFileUploadRequest: Abstract class to handle file upload using Volley. Derived classes must provide the file byte data.

Important Notes:

    API Key: The code contains an API key for the Hybrid Analysis service. Ensure that it is kept confidential and not shared or exposed.
    Error Handling: The code contains error handling mechanisms to provide feedback to the user in case of failures.
    Animations: Uses animations for visual appeal, especially when displaying scan results.
    Back-Press Handling: If loading is ongoing, pressing the back button cancels the operation and informs the user.

Usage:

    Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read files from the device.
    Use the file selection option to choose a file for scanning.
    After selecting, an alert dialog confirms the scanning process.
    Once confirmed, the file is uploaded, scanned, and results are displayed in a pie chart and cards.
    The UI adapts based on the user's dark mode preference.

Dependencies:

Make sure you have the following dependencies added to your project:

    Volley (for network requests)
    Any charting library for the PieChart (not explicitly mentioned in the code)

Conclusion:

This code provides a comprehensive solution for file scanning and analysis using the Hybrid Analysis API on Android. Ensure that you have all the necessary permissions and dependencies set up before using this in your project.
